File Descriptions:

BsalManagement_BaseRates.csv - This file contains the median and 95% confidence interval for 
the base rates, i.e. with no management, for each parameter. 
Notes: cH estimates are generated from the autologistic function used in the occupancy model 
(the alpha and beta of the autologic function were from thee JAGS model of CHOH data 
and psi was 0.7 (which is the high occupancy scenario we used)).  All other parameters are
expert elicited.

BsalManagement_Parameter_MinMax.csv - This file contains for each parameter:
a mean of the q50 values across all management actions, a minimum value which is the min
value of the 2.5% quantile across all actions, and a maximum value which is the maximum 
value of the 97.5 % quantile

"cS"  = Bsal colonization
"cH" = Host colonization ( this is only in the base rate file, because its not affected by management).
"dL"  = decline from high Bsal to low Bsal
"eL"  =  decline from high Bsal to no Bsal
"eS" =   extinction from low Bsal to no Bsal
"gS" = growth from low Bsal to high Bsal
"phiHL" = Host persistence with high Bsal occupancy
"phiHS" =  Host persistence with low Bsal occupancy
"phiHb" = Host persistence with no BD
